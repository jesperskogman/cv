		<h3>Facts about me</h3>

<p>Greetings my name is jesper Skogman and I am a 23 years old college graduate living in Sweden. I saw your work add in the newspaper and thought that I would try to apply so here are some facts about me and what I like to do and some of my skills.</p>


<p>When I started playing video games i did not know any English at all, but after awhile I started to understand more and eventually I was able to speak and understand English. Later I started to play online and then I had to learn how to start communicating and talking with other English speakers. Up to this point I only played on console but after a while I decided to buy myself a PC, it was not the best but it managed. I started to play with some classmates and we even had thoughts on starting a competitive Dota 2 team.</p>

<p>I started playing music early in my life. It began with me getting Guitar Hero 3 on the Playstation 2 and after I heard the epic tunes of the gods themselves, I too wanted to play the guitar. So when I began sixth grade I started to take guitar lessons. It started slow and I did not get to play the songs that I wanted to play and to top it all of, I got stuck with an acoustic guitar when I wanted to play electric. After a while I stopped going to the lessons for about a year, but then I decided to start going again and because the old bassist quit I was asked if I wanted to play the bass and I accepted. After that I got to play in almost all the bands because I was the only bassist. After that music just stuck with me.</p>

<p>During this time i have managed to acquire different skills that has helped me during my life, for example I am really good at adapting new skills and new work methods because of my bass playing and the sudden shift and all the work that was put on me with all the new bands and a entire new instrument. I am also excellent at communicating and socializing both because of my time in different bands but also because of my time playing video games and having to communicate with my team. I grew up on a farm so I am used to physical work and getting the job done. Some other interesting facts about me is that i always aim to do the impossible and i can play the entire Iron Man by Black Sabbath on bass.</p>

<p>I have a very broad set of skills and I know that I really can help your company grow and expand into the future. I can also be placed in almost any work environment and still do a great job because of my different set of skills and experiences.
